1. Include a function named `displayGreaterThan` with the following arguments:
    - An array of integers
    - The size of the array
    - A number n
2. The function `displayGreaterThan` should:
    - Display all numbers in the array that are greater than the parameter n
3. Prompt the user to input values to fill integer array
4. Prompt the user to input comparison value `n`

## Running the Code
For the best results, run the program directly from the terminal.

1. Navigate to the folder containing the program file:
```
cd /path/to/folder
```
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
```
g++ main.cpp -o program
```
3. Run the program:
```
./program
```
