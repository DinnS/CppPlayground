# Test Scores Part 1

## The program should
1. Whenever possible use pointer notation rather than array notation.
2. Dynamically allocate an array based on the user-defined size.
3. Prompt the user to input test scores and validate they are non-negative.
4. Define a function named `sortScoreAscending` that:
    - Sort the scores in ascending order
5. Define a function named `calculateAverageScore` that:
    - Calculate and return the average of the scores.
6. Display:
    - The sorted list of scores.
    - The average score.

## Running the Code
For the best results, run the program directly from the terminal.

1. Navigate to the folder containing the program file:
```
cd /path/to/folder
```
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
```
g++ main.cpp -o program
```
3. Run the program:
```
./program
```
