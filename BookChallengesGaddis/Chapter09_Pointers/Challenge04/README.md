# Test Scores Part 2

## The program should
1. Use the code from Challenge02
2. Allow the user to input name–score pairs, where:
    - Each student’s name is paired with their test score, using array.
3. Modify the sorting function to:
    - Sort both arrays (names and scores) together based on test scores in ascending order.
4. Use pointers instead of array subscripts when stepping through the arrays.
5. Display the sorted list of scores, showing each student’s name alongside their score.

## Running the Code
For the best results, run the program directly from the terminal.

1. Navigate to the folder containing the program file:
```
cd /path/to/folder
```
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
```
g++ main.cpp -o program
```
3. Run the program:
```
./program
```
