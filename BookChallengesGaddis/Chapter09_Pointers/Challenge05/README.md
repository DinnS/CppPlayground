# Test Scores Part 2

## The program should
1. Rewrite the given function to use pointers as parameters instead of reference variables.
2. Demonstrate the function in a complete program by:
    - Declaring two integer variables.
    - Passing their addresses to the function.
    - Displaying the results after the function modifies the variables.

## Running the Code
For the best results, run the program directly from the terminal.

1. Navigate to the folder containing the program file:
```
cd /path/to/folder
```
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:
```
g++ main.cpp -o program
```
3. Run the program:
```
./program
```
