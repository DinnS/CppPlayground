# C++ Book Challenges and Small Projects

## Description

This repository contains:
- **BookChallengesGaddis**: My solutions to various challenges from the book **"Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures to Objects" by Tony Gaddis, Pearson (2017)**. Each folder represents a chapter with completed challenges, covering a range of C++ topics from basics to advanced concepts. Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or suggestions are welcome!

- **Projects**: A collection of small projects in C++ created to explore concepts beyond the book exercises and develop practical coding skills.


## Folder Structure

In the **BookChallengesGaddis** folder, you’ll find solutions organized by chapter. Here’s a quick overview of what each chapter covers:

- **Chapter07_ArraysVectors**: Solutions for challenges on arrays, vectors, and their applications. Includes examples of sorting, searching, and using STL vectors.
- **Chapter09_Pointers**: Focuses on pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and pointer arithmetic.
- **Chapter12_FileOperations**: Demonstrates file input/output operations, including reading from and writing to files.
- **Chapter13_IntroClasses**: Introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes, covering class definitions, member functions, and constructors.

## How to Compile

To compile any of the solutions or projects, navigate to the respective folder and use the following command:

1. Compile the code : g++ <file_name>.cpp -o <output_name>
2. Run the compiled program: <output_name>

**Example**
```
cd BookChallengesGaddis/Chapter07_ArraysVectors/Challenge01
g++ example_challenge.cpp -o example_challenge
./example_challenge
```

Detailed and specific instructions on how to compile the project can be found in the folder containing the corresponding folder with .cpp files. Please refer to these instructions for a step-by-step guide.
